- Perhaps have the model gain access do data up to a certain date before it needs to access the database
- Context window: Models have a token limit (~4K–8K+ tokens). Too long a chat history will need to be trimmed.
    - Have the ai search for a specific time frame

- Have your model train based on your conversations instead of looking in the database


Final goal = Have a model Automatically learns more and more about you and your life as you talk to it. You should be able to aks the chatbot to
    refer back to a certain point in time or talking  point and it should be able to bring it up in detail and when you mentioned it.

Goal for:
    - Version 1: CHECK
        - A chatbot that connects to your database to fetch information on startup and save in chat history
        - All chats will save to the database automatically

    - Version 2:
        - Simple chat history
        - Use commands/code words to dictate when it will access local database

    UPDATED
        - Add configuration (Frontend, database for configs, etc)
        - Example on configuration schema/object:
            - model


Notes:
    Models can save a certain amount of tokens/words in it's history before it starts to forget.
    - Mistral = So, 8,000 tokens ≈ ~6,000 words ≈ ~24,000 characters
    - Think about potentiall storing logs
        - Cons = It wont remember word for word but that would make it a more human like interaction.
